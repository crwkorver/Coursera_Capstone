    "The [**Halewijn Prijs**](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halewijnprijs,_literatuurprijs_van_de_stad_Roermond) is a Dutch national award, intended for literary talent that, based on quality and irresistibility of his or her published work, deserves extra interest. The prize consists of a cash prize and a bronze small statue made by Dick van Wijk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, it was decided that the yearly Award Ceremony will take place in the Haarlem region of the Netherlands. To attain maximal public attendance, the ideal neighborhood would be in the vicinity of the railway station in order to facilitate traveling by public means in a car-crowded city like Haarlem. Furthermore, to maximize potential book sales, a location should be found that is in the near vicinity of book shops around. Finally, ample restaurants should be present here as well, to accommodate the audience (and the winner and jury members, who will dine together afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to find an optimal location for the Award Ceremony. The report will be targeted to the organizing committee of the Foundation Circle Halewijn, but could be useful to other stakeholders such as book retailers and literary organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will localize **existing book shops in the Haarlem region**. Second, we are interested in **areas with ample restaurants in vicinity**. Results will be combined, and finally confined to an area **within a walking distance of 2.5 kilometers from the Central Railway Station**. \n",
